## Algorithm Details

### Detector Response Functions

The system generates 15 Gaussian-shaped detector response functions:
- **Center wavelengths**: Distributed across 400-1000nm range
- **Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)**: 50nm (configurable)
- **Peak transmittance**: 50% at center wavelength
- **Coverage**: Overlapping responses ensure complete spectral coverage

### Spectral Reconstruction

**Ridge Regression with Cross-Validation**:
1. Detector measurements serve as input features (15 dimensions)
2. True hyperspectral data serves as target (250 dimensions)
3. Ridge regression minimizes: ||y - XÎ²||Â² + Î±||Î²||Â²
4. Optimal Î± selected via k-fold cross-validation or Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **RÂ² Score**: Coefficient of determination
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
- **Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)**: Angular difference between spectra
- **Relative Error**: Normalized absolute error

### Noise Simulation

Realistic noise is added to detector measurements:
- **Noise type**: Gaussian noise
- **Noise level**: 1% of signal magnitude (configurable)
- **SNR calculation**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio in dB

## Visualizations and Results

The system automatically generates comprehensive visualizations to analyze detector performance and reconstruction quality:

### 1. Detector Response Functions

![Detector Responses](imgs/plots/detector_responses.png)

**Analysis**: Shows the 15 Gaussian detector response functions covering the 400-1000nm range. The top panel displays individual detector responses with their center wavelengths, while the bottom panel shows the combined coverage ensuring complete spectral range coverage with good uniformity.

### 2. Spectral Reconstruction Comparison

![Spectral Comparison](imgs/plots/spectral_comparison.png)

**Analysis**: Compares true (blue solid line) vs reconstructed (red dashed line) spectra for multiple samples. The gray filled areas represent reconstruction errors. High RÂ² values (>0.97) and low MSE demonstrate excellent reconstruction quality across different spectral signatures.

### 3. Performance Statistics

![Reconstruction Stats](imgs/plots/reconstruction_stats.png)

**Analysis**: Comprehensive performance metrics display including overall scores, cross-validation distributions, and fold-by-fold analysis. Shows consistent performance across CV folds with RÂ² > 0.96 and low variance.

### 4. Error Analysis

![Error Analysis](imgs/plots/error_analysis.png)

**Analysis**: Four-panel error analysis showing: (1) wavelength-wise mean absolute error, (2) error distribution histogram, (3) true vs predicted scatter plot with 1:1 reference line, and (4) relative error by wavelength. Demonstrates uniform error distribution and high correlation.

### 5. Principal Component Analysis

![PCA Analysis](imgs/plots/pca_analysis.png)

**Analysis**: PCA visualization comparing true and reconstructed spectra in reduced dimensionality space. Shows excellent overlap between true (blue) and reconstructed (red) data points, indicating preservation of spectral structure.

### 6. Regularization Parameter Selection

![Alpha Selection](imgs/plots/alpha_selection.png)

**Analysis**: Ridge regression regularization parameter (Î±) optimization through cross-validation. Shows the selection process, optimal Î± value, model coefficients, and training performance metrics.

> **Note**: All visualizations feature improved legend positioning that places legends outside the plot area to avoid overlapping with data, ensuring clear readability of both the plots and legend information.

## Customization

### Adding New Datasets

1. Extend the `HyperspectralDataLoader` class in `src/data_utils.py`
2. Implement a new loading method following the existing pattern
3. Update the configuration to include your dataset parameters

### Modifying Detector Configurations

Edit detector parameters in the configuration file:
- `num_detectors`: Number of detectors (default: 15)
- `detector_fwhm`: Full width at half maximum in nm
- `overlap_factor`: Detector spacing overlap factor

### Alternative Reconstruction Methods

The modular design allows easy integration of other reconstruction algorithms:
1. Create a new reconstructor class following the `SpectralReconstructor` interface
2. Implement `train()` and `predict()` methods
3. Update the main pipeline to use your new reconstructor

## Troubleshooting

**Memory Issues**:
- Reduce `num_samples` in configuration
- Use synthetic data instead of large real datasets

**Poor Reconstruction Performance**:
- Check data quality and preprocessing settings
- Adjust noise level and detector parameters
- Try different alpha selection methods

**Visualization Errors**:
- Ensure matplotlib backend is properly configured
- Use `--no-plots` flag to disable visualization
- Check file permissions for saving plots
